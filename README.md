*Hello, I'm Gabriel!*

*I'm a software developer from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, with a degree in Computer Science and over a decade of professional experience. My journey began in 2011 as a front-end developer using HTML, jQuery, and Bootstrap. However, I soon discovered my passion for Java, a technology I decided to specialize in and have been working with ever since.*

*Currently, I develop Java applications focused on the payment processing industry, with the goal of handling credit card, pix, and bank slip transactions. Throughout my career, I've had the opportunity to work with frameworks such as Spring, Quarkus, and JHipster, and following the evolution of these technologies has been a major source of motivation for my continuous growth.*

*I am also aiming to obtain a Java certification, and I will use this GitHub repository to centralize my studies and share my progress.*
